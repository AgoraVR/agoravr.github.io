Events in Agora can be run in two ways:
-Multi-event mode
-Single-event mode

By default, the world starts in multi-event mode. The button to toggle between modes is located in the staff area.

To host an event in multi-event mode, simply enter a venue, activate the player in the venue, and paste the DJ's link into the video player inside the venue.

To host an event in single-event mode, enter the door code into the keypad near the staff area door and walk through the door. Find the large button to toggle the master video player on and enable single-event mode.

Single-event mode enables AudioLink and VRSL.

The staff area can be used to toggle on/off the spaces in Agora, and to highlight spaces that are the focus of the event.

For the door code to the staff room, join the group and the Discord and become an event host.
