# Agora-VR
--An expandable multipurpose gathering space in the Metaverse.--

Agora is a multipurpose gathering place‚ offering 45+ spaces to be used as clubs‚ hangouts‚ stores‚ showrooms‚ and everything in-between.
 
Our goal is to build a space for groups to host events from small to large, public or private, and for artists and creators to showcase their work to new customers.
 
This place is still very much a work in progress. If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions, contact Utami Hasegawa.

**Guidelines for new spaces**

Spaces in Agora fall into one of three broad categories: Venues, Stores, and Hangouts.

*Venues*

Examples of venues include music clubs, theaters, classrooms, and presentation spaces. Generally, a venue includes a streaming video player (either at the venue or hidden away in the back-room), for live-streaming media to an audience.

*Stores*

Examples of stores include shops, showrooms, galleries, and avatar showcases. Shops are spaces for artists and creators to showcase their work and attract new customers.

*Hangouts*

Examples of hangouts include lounges, chillout areas, and game rooms. Hangouts are free-form gathering spaces that usually, but not always, include a video player for background music or group viewings.
